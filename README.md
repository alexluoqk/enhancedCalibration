## Abstract
With the rapid development of online health communities (OHCs), patients increasingly seek medical consultations through digital platforms. However, consultation intentions often remain uncertain due to fluctuating motivations and exploratory behaviors. This study proposes the "Intention-Cognition-Calibration" (ICC) framework, leveraging dynamic cognitive coherence and fairness calibration to enhance the prediction of consulting intentions in doctor-patient interactions. By employing large language models (LLMs) and multi-source corpus calibration strategies, the framework improves predictive confidence and trustworthiness. Experimental results demonstrate that cognitive coherence enhances semantic alignment, while fairness calibration mitigates biases across heterogeneous data. The construction of a Clinical Medical Knowledge Graph (CMKG) further facilitates diagnostic efficiency. This research advances AI-driven healthcare applications and contributes to the sustainable development of intelligent medical consulting systems.
